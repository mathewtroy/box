## :label: Project Description
With the rapid development of web technologies, modern web applications are increasingly embedded in daily activities for individuals and organizations. However, the rise in reliance on these technologies has led to a surge in malicious activities aimed at exploiting common security weaknesses. Vulnerabilities such as Injection, Cryptographic Failures, and Broken Access Control can lead to severe financial and reputational damage. The primary motivation behind this project is to examine these vulnerabilities and demonstrate potential exploitations, ultimately contributing to better security practices in web application development.

## :label: Project Goals
1. **Research Web Vulnerabilities**: Study common web vulnerabilities, including XSS, SQL Injection, and CSRF, along with vulnerability detection methods.
2. **Develop Vulnerable Application**: Create a PHP-based web application with intentional security flaws to demonstrate the identified vulnerabilities.
3. **Vulnerability Exploitation**: Analyze and demonstrate how vulnerabilities can be exploited within the application.
4. **Detection Program**: Develop a program capable of detecting vulnerabilities in the application.
5. **Application Testing**: Conduct testing to assess both the vulnerabilities in the application and the detection program.
